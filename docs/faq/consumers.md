# Consumers FAQ

* #### When will users be able to send kin between apps in the ecosystem? 
  Once the ecosystem grows a little bigger, we will provide an easy way to use Kin earned inside Kinit on other apps that are part of the ecosystem (including Kik).
  The detailed solution is a work in progress, but eventually users should be able to use Kin earned in app X on app Y. 
       
* #### When will there be more spending options? 
  This initial integration lays the foundation for future experiences.
  Additional features are currently in the works, and these will create more ways for users to earn and spend Kin in Kik. 
  As Kin’s integration in Kik scales, its users will be empowered with tools to create and add value to the platform.
  Users will also be rewarded when they create value for each other.
       
* #### Can I export my Kin to a cryptocurrency exchange and trade for cash or other cryptocurrencies? 
  Generally speaking, it is possible to trade Kin for cash on public exchanges.
  However, until full functionality of the app is developed, the first phases of this feature will not provide you with an option to move your Kin to another wallet for the purpose of trading or exchanging.  
       
* #### Is there a limit to the amount of Kin I can acquire? 
  There will only ever be 10 Trillion Kin that can be put into circulation, but you will earn opportunities every day within the ecosystem apps and Kinit app to acquire more Kin. 
       
* #### Can I be confident that the Kin I earn is secure? 
  When the ecosystem team created the SDK for implementation there were many integral measures set in place for validation and security relating to each individual API to make sure that your information and Kin is secured.
       
* #### Do I have to pay taxes on the Kin that I earn? 
  Taxes will vary by jurisdiction and each person must consult his / her own tax advisor.
  However, in the U.S., the IRS has classified KIN as property, not currency, and therefore, can be subject to tax.
       
* #### Do I keep my Kin forever, or do they expire if I don’t use them? 
  Your Kin never “expire”.
  They are backed up on the blockchain and that ledger is kept forever.
       
* #### Is this integration on the blockchain you’re building? Or the others you were using? 
  As you may recall, Kin announced they’ll we’ll be creating our own blockchain, based on Stellar.
  All of the transactions made are on the Kin blockchain and not on the public Stellar infrastructure.
  The Ethereum network will still be in use for the purpose of exchanges (trade the token) and all in-app transactions are on the Kin network.
       
* #### I was a TDE participant and am an active Kin holder. Can I use my Kin in Kik? 
  We start with a very limited number of users who’ll experience the new feature in the first phase.
  The purpose is to test out the new experience and deliver a perfect product to the end users.
  The number of users using the new app will grow gradually and if you don’t see it just yet -  please stay tuned to learn about the future roll-out plan.
       
* #### What’s the point if I can’t exchange Kin on Binance (or other)? 
  The goal is to bring the Kin experience to non-crypto experts.
  It is the first time that consumers will get their hands on Kin and will be able to participate in a new in-app experience.
