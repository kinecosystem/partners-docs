# Partners FAQ

* #### What is Kin?
  Kin is a new cryptocurrency created by one of the world’s most popular messaging apps, Kik.
  Based on the idea that when we all work together everybody wins, Kin has created a way for your favorite sites, services, and brands to get rewarded for creating awesome user experiences rather than using ads, charging for subscriptions, or selling your personal information. 
  Kin puts you exactly where you belong, at the center of your digital life.
  
* #### How is Kin different from other Digital Currencies?
  As a cryptocurrency, Kin is different from the usual ‘digital currencies’ you're familiar with (think Xbox Points or Twitch Bits).
  Typical in-app or in-game currencies are centralized, meaning they're controlled by one company and accepted on only one app or service.
  By contrast, Kin is fully decentralized so that no one person or company has control over it.
  It can be earned and spent across a whole ecosystem of apps and services.
  And, as a tradeable asset with guaranteed scarcity, it has a real market value in dollars, and becomes more valuable as more consumers demand it.
  
* #### What makes Kin special among cryptocurrencies?
  We believe that Kin will be the most used cryptocurrency by the end of 2018, and the first to be widely adopted by mainstream consumers.  
  How do we know?
    1. It was created by the makers of the Kik chat app. Kik has 15 million active users, and by the end of the year, all of them will be given a wallet and ways to earn and spend Kin. Kik is a unicorn startup headquartered in Canada, with nearly 200 employees, and offices in the United States and Israel. Investors in funding rounds for Kik prior to the Kin project include Tencent and Union Square Ventures. Kik has a decade-long history of marketing with household name brands.
    2. Kin is providing SDKs for Android and iOS that can bring a Kin wallet and marketplace into any app in 5 minutes, as well as a Python SDK for web services. They're also partnered with Unity to provide an SDK for easy integration into your favorite mobile games. And they're running a $3 million developer incentives program for up to 25 developers that integrate Kin into their app.
    3. Developers are further incentivized to integrate Kin and expand the app ecosystem through the KRE - the Kin Rewards Engine. Over the coming years, the KRE will use 60% of the total Kin token supply to reward developers every day, based on how much value their users create within the Kin economy. This is a fundamentally new way for app developers to monetize without necessarily running ads or selling products - just by promoting positive user experiences and consumer-to-consumer transactions. Where other cryptocurrencies reward mining or staking, Kin rewards meaningful network activity.  
  Kin will be the first cryptocurrency to demonstrate real consumer scale, using the hybrid Kin Blockchain. The Kin Blockchain combines the best of both worlds from two competing blockchains, Ethereum and Stellar. Kin tokens can exist on either blockchain, sharing a total supply, and in the future, will be swapped back and forth as they enter or exit the Ecosystem of apps. Inside the Ecosystem, Kin tokens will use a custom 'fork' of Stellar to achieve high throughput, enabling over 1.2 million transactions per day. When withdrawn from the Ecosystem, Kin tokens will move to Ethereum for maximum decentralization, security, and liquidity on exchanges.
   
* #### What's the current status of Kin's development?
  Kin is following a simple three-step plan to assert dominance over the consumer crypto industry:
    1. Find a blockchain that can scale for mainstream consumer adoption.
    2. Use Kik and Kinit to make Kin the world's most used cryptocurrency.
    3. Incentivize an ecosystem of apps and services to integrate Kin and win together. 

* #### So, how far along are we on each step? (last updated July 20, 2018) 
  1. The [hybrid Kin Blockchain (Ethereum/Stellar)](https://medium.com/kinblog/kin-blockchain-taking-fate-into-our-own-hands-f5bdfa759502) is now live, and has been [tested at over 1.2 million REAL transactions per day](https://medium.com/inside-kin/scaling-kin-blockchain-status-update-ca4f323d3e99). The team will continue tweaking and stress testing the blockchain to achieve even greater scale. The atomic swap that will enable converting KIN between blockchains has been [demonstrated as a proof of concept](https://www.reddit.com/r/KinFoundation/comments/8p23xm/biweekly_update_june_5/) and is being developed for production.
  2. The Kin Marketplace Beta was [launched in Kik](https://medium.com/kinblog/unlocking-product-opportunities-for-kik-d97185235ab1) to 1,000 lucky Android users on June 27th, and has added thousands of additional users since. The Marketplace offers Kik users the ability to earn Kin through surveys and quizzes, and then spend Kin on premium chat themes. As the Kik beta is developed further, squashing bugs and adding new features, they will continue to increase the number of users until the public launch for all 15 million of Kik's active users. The Kinit app beta for Android was [launched for all US residents](https://medium.com/kinblog/kinit-beta-app-now-live-in-google-play-372e975804d0) on July 17th and has already achieved over a thousand installs, as well as being a trending Finance app and [holding a 4.9 rating](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.kinecosystem.kinit). Kinit offers users the ability to earn Kin through surveys, quizzes, Swelly polls, and video ads, and then spend Kin on a variety of popular gift cards and coupons from Blackhawk.
  3. Kin continues to sign [partners like IMVU](https://medium.com/kinblog/imvu-and-kin-partner-to-deliver-native-crypto-experiences-in-3d-social-networks-3c1c8089172a) to integrate their cryptocurrency, [offering them a grant of Kin for signing](https://medium.com/kinblog/reimagining-value-in-the-digital-world-part-2-61213ea5a192) and hitting future milestones for the users and value they bring to the Ecosystem. This functions as a 'manual' preview of what the Kin Rewards Engine (KRE) will achieve as an automated process in the future. Kin also [announced a $3 million incentive program for 25 developers](https://medium.com/kinblog/kin-developer-program-launches-today-f4f2822d4cf2) to integrate Kin over the remainder of 2018 and into 2019, offering considerable cash and Kin rewards for hitting milestones of onboarded users. The Kin partnerships team has [been attending Unity events](https://medium.com/kinblog/kin-unity-gaming-sdk-collaboration-kicks-off-at-largest-developer-conference-in-korea-c1eb96356a8a) in support of their partnership to bring a Kin SDK to the Unity game engine. They plan on [recruiting an additional group of game developers](https://medium.com/kinblog/the-kin-gaming-sdk-on-unity-c8e7c1dd64ef) to beta test the Unity SDK over the coming months.
