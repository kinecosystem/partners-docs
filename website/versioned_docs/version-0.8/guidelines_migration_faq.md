# Kin Migration FAQ

## Technical

#### Does it mean I need the new SDK? What does this mean for my users?
The migration process will occur in the background once the KIN entrypoint (Kin.Start()) is called. The migration process itself takes ~15 seconds during which time the user is blocked from using SDK functions.

#### How long will it take for a user to migrate (what's the user experience)?
The migration process will occur in the background once the KIN entrypoint (Kin.Start()) is called. The migration process itself takes around 15 seconds during which the user is blocked from using SDK functions.

#### What will happen to users who did not update to new app version?
Users of an older SDK version will not be able to earn/spend more KIN until they upgrade their app to initiate the SDK that supports the new blockchain.

Registering a new user on an older SDK version will fail.

#### Will I have to force update?
We recommend that (if you have the capability) you show a force update message to users who don't have the new blockchain-supported SDK version.

#### Is the migration flow different between Android and iOS?
The flow is the same. However, there are different events and documentation available for each platform. For this information, please refer to the documentation on our website.

#### What happens to new users that enter the app during and after the migration process? Do they need to go through migration?
New users on the new blockchain don't go through migration. Once your app is set on the new blockchain, any new user that will engage with the app will only interact with the new blockchain. 

#### Is there a way to tell if the user has migrated or not?
On the Android SDK, call Kin.getKinSdkVersion() which returns KinSdkVersion, an enum. Possible values are OLD_KIN_SDK or NEW_KIN_SDK. These refer to the current blockchain and the new Kin blockchain respectively.

On the iOS SDK you should check isMigrated function, The value is persistent and will remain across sessions unless the user removes and re-installs the app.

#### Where in my user flow should I call Kin.start?
Kin.start should be called early in your user's flow. The earlier you call it, the better the chance that the user would already be migrated before they start earning Kin in your application.

#### Can QR codes from the old blockchain restore wallets on the new blockchain?
The key pairs will be the same so users can still use the QR code (if they saved it) during their backup. We always recommend prompting your users to use the backup and restore functionalities.

#### Does the server know the wallet status?
Yes, the migration status of each wallet is kept both on the server and the blockchain.

#### What happens to the user's transaction history?
The marketplace transaction history is kept. If you've been using the paymentConfirmation to double check the existence of a transaction on the blockchain, you will have to start checking on the new blockchain. Old transactions will not be transferred between blockchains, making all users accounts on the blockchain seem new and without history.

## Issues and Errors

#### Will launching a new app using the platform SDK before the migration cause any issues?
No, but you will need to migrate your new users on that application to the new blockchain. It might be best to launch after the migration flag is raised so that those users are automatically created on the new blockchain.

#### What happens when a user that is migrated tries to send Kin to a user that has not migrated (peer to peer)?
The transaction should go through on the new blockchain. The receiving user will only be able to access the funds when he migrates his wallet.

#### What happens if the migration is happening when the user is in the middle of earning Kin?
The SDK will detect that the migration has begun, will migrate the current wallet and will raise an error to the caller - failing the current earn flow. The user will have to start the earn flow over again - this time on the new blockchain.

#### What happens if the app crashes or loses network connection during SDK migration process?
The SDK always tries to re-execute the migration. Re-executing will continue from where the process stopped and will complete successfully. If the migration failure persists, please log the error and show a message to the user.

#### What happens if the migration gets terminated, does it restart automatically?
The migration will restart automatically from its last known state if it hadn't completed successfully.

## Timing

#### When do you expect the migration to be completed?
We will try to align to your schedule. We will not be turning off the previous blockchain any time soon, but would like everyone to update their SDK, and publish to their respective app stores in the month following the SDK's release. The most important thing is that a large percentage of your users update their app with the new SDK before raising the migration flag so that migration is smooth.

#### When will the old blockchain be retired?
The old blockchain will stay up while not all partners have migrated. Once all partners and developers have transitioned to the new blockchain, the old blockchain is redundant and can be retried. We will keep the old blockchain history, but it will not be accessible via horizon.
